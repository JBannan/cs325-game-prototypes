<h2>Chicken Fling</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
My game uses phaser springs as a way to control the player chicken. Rather than following the mouse pointer or using the arrow keys, the player must fling the chicken around to collect the eggs.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The game has more customized hit-boxes to fit the sprites better allowing better collisions.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
Combining two different physics systems in phaser isn't possible and there is no way for the objects to interact with each other. The snake was originally made using Arcade physics like it was in a phaser example. The chicken was made following a P2 physics spring example and the egg was made to have a custom collision region. 
Phaser doesn't allow for these two systems to interact and so the snakes movement had to be changed to be in line with P2 physics systems.

<li>The code for this example is adapted from the <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/v2.6.2/resources/Project%20Templates/Basic">Phaser Basic Project Template</a></li>
<li>The snake was modified from the Phaser snake example</li>
<li>The chicken and controls were modified from the Phaser P2 physics spring example</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Fling the chicken around to collect the eggs before the snake eats them.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme: </strong>
Chicken
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The controls use the mouse pointer as an end point of a spring to fling the chicken around. The game has a score system, though it does not persist between attempts. The player has a limited number of lives as well. The enemy now moves and can harm the player.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This game was made to test phasers P2 physics system. The main parts being tested were the spring system and the custom collision areas.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player should 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
 Click and hold to drag the chicken towards the mouse. Fling the chicken at the eggs to collect them. The snake will also attempt to eat the eggs. If the snake eats an egg your score will decrease. If the snake hits the chicken more than 10 times, the game is over.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The player can play for as long as possible without mush risk of game over by balancing the amount of eggs they collect with the amount the snake eats. The snakes speed is tied to the players score so the player has to keep the chicken from flying too far away to maintain decent control and not get hurt.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A hungry snake has slithered its way into the chickens home. The chicken (player) must rescue the eggs before they get eaten by the snake.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Players with a bit of free time looking for a mindless game to play.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
 Under 2 Minutes
