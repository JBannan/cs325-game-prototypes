<h2>Jump The Gun</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The game is a platformer that aims to use the recoil from the player's weapon as a primary method of movement.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The game uses a tilemap to build the level and directly translates the tiles there to tangible objects.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
My original plan was to use P2 physics so that I could shoot a projectile at a platform and then connect the player (via their weapon) and the platform where it was shot with a spring with no springiness. This was completely scrapped when I found out that phaser weapons would never use anything but Arcade physics. These different physics systems would never interact so any bullet/platform interaction is impossible.
I also considered using box2d that looked like it had weapon/rope/platform physics that i wanted to implement, but came at a price over $0, too much for me. Having never gotten past the weapon system, the rest of the game (more level/enemies/score) has not yet been implemented.
Additionally, Recoil was also bugged, always accelerating the player in the (same) wrong direction or not doing anything.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>The code for this example is adapted from the <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/v2.6.2/resources/Project%20Templates/Basic">Phaser Basic Project Template</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Blast yourself around the map and destroy any enemies you find. (Formerly Grapple/Swing around...)
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Implement Tilemaps to speed up level design. Use Recoil as a movement function.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can use W/A/D to Jump/Move Left/Move Right. The spacebar will fire the player's weapon downwards and accelerate the player upwards.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Currently, the player can just spam fire and essentially have a jetpack to move around with.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
N/a
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Players of platformer games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The game only has enough content for ~1 minute or things to play around with.
