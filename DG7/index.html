<h2>Jump The Gun</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The game is a platformer that aims to use the recoil from the player's weapon as a primary method of movement.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The game uses a tilemap to build the level and directly translates the tiles there to tangible objects. Weapon pickups are now placed in the level with a tilemap as an object layer.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
Again I tried to implement complex P2 physics and grappling functionality. This time I tried to use raycasting rather than a weapon to shoot the grappling hook at a platform. This caused an immense amount of trouble and never worked properly. 
Instead I refined the gun recoil movement idea so that the player would be pushed opposite to the direction they fired. This gave me a kind of twitch air movement to play with. I added some variance in bullet speed to make it a bit more interesting. 
Enemies have also been added to the game.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>The code for this example is adapted from the <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/v2.6.2/resources/Project%20Templates/Basic">Phaser Basic Project Template</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Blast yourself around the map and destroy any enemies you find.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Further implement Tilemaps as JSON to speed up level design. Enable unlocking new weapon types with pickups around the level.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can use W/A/D to Jump/Move Left/Move Right. The spacebar will fire the player's weapon at the mouse and recoil the player in the opposite direction. This can be used as a form of movement but is planned to be limited by ammo in the future.
 Pressing X will switch weapon modes. The first, a shotgun, has limited range, high recoil, and is more influenced by gravity. The second is more of a sniper rifle with more range, faster bullets, less drop-off, and less recoil. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Currently, the player can just spam fire and essentially have a jetpack to move around with. While movement around most of the level is possible with normal jumping, Spamming the shotgun or the machine gun may still be a more viable movement strategy.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
N/a
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Players of platformer games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The game only has enough content for ~1 minute of things to play around with.
