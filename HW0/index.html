<h2>Shoot Man</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The game is a platformer that focuses on the player being able to bounce a bullet at an enemy.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit: </strong>
    Bullets are able to bounce off of the world boundaries and platforms. With this, the player can try more interesting shots.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
    Having to make a game via code is time consuming, and having to look up every something.somethingElse property makes it worse. Debugging with 
    the dev console in Chrome really made things easier.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
    I made all of my assets from scratch. The images were made in photoshop and the sound effectes were made in bfxr.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
While I didn't borrow code/mechanics from a particular game or Phaser Example, I took inspiration from the puzzle platformer genre.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
    A platformer where Players shoot all of the enemies scattered around the game world.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>There are 4 direct inputs with a 5th indirect input(mouse pointer location) used to play the game.</li>
        <li> There is no randomness currently in the game due to the ideal playstyle being to skillfully rebound a shot at a target. Bullet variation was only frustrating in this case.</li>
        <li>Genre: Platformer/Shooter</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
    This prototype mainly focuses on the shooting mechanic. The assets, platform position, and movement are all barebones. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
    Players should try to estimate the best angle to fire a shot, either at an enemy or at a wall.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
The player can move around the world using the arrow keys. There are enemies scattered about that the player must shoot to eliminate. Player's bullets can bounce off of the world bounds and platforms, so the player may use this to their advantage. Planned for the game was a damage system that would require multiple shots to hit an enemy, a score system that would account for time and number of shots used, and a greater variety of enemy types and animations.
<ul>
    <li>Jump: UP Arrow</li>
    <li>Move Left/Right: LEFT/RIGHT Arrow</li>
    <li>Shoot: SPACEBAR (Fires a shot at the mouse pointer)</li>
</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
For certain enemies, the player's best option is to move to a better position and shoot at them directly. Other enemies require the player to get into a position for a rebound shot to hit the enemy. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
There is no story in the current version. It is meant to be more of a mindless platformer/shooter.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Players of Puzzle/Platformer games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
 Under 5 minutes
</li>
